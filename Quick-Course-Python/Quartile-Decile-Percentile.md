Let's break down **Quartile**, **Decile**, and **Percentile** along with their definitions, use cases, and corresponding Python code examples. These statistical measures help in understanding the distribution of data by dividing it into equal parts.

### 1. **Quartiles**

**Definition**:
Quartiles are values that divide a dataset into four equal parts, each representing a quarter (25%) of the data. The three quartiles are:

- **Q1 (First Quartile)**: The 25th percentile (the value below which 25% of the data falls).
- **Q2 (Second Quartile)**: The 50th percentile (also called the median, divides the data into two halves).
- **Q3 (Third Quartile)**: The 75th percentile (the value below which 75% of the data falls).

#### Use Case:

Quartiles are useful in determining the spread and central tendency of data. For example, in financial analysis, quartiles can help understand income distribution.

#### Python Code Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55]

# Calculate quartiles using numpy
Q1 = np.percentile(data, 25)  # First Quartile (25th percentile)
Q2 = np.percentile(data, 50)  # Second Quartile (50th percentile or median)
Q3 = np.percentile(data, 75)  # Third Quartile (75th percentile)

print(f"Q1 (25th Percentile): {Q1}")
print(f"Q2 (50th Percentile, Median): {Q2}")
print(f"Q3 (75th Percentile): {Q3}")
```

### 2. **Deciles**

**Definition**:
Deciles divide a dataset into ten equal parts. Each decile represents 10% of the data. The first decile is the 10th percentile, the second decile is the 20th percentile, and so on.

#### Use Case:

Deciles are often used in educational statistics, where scores are ranked, and students can see how they perform relative to others.

#### Python Code Example:

```python
# Calculate deciles using numpy
deciles = [np.percentile(data, i*10) for i in range(1, 10)]

# Print decile values
for i, decile in enumerate(deciles, 1):
    print(f"D{i} (Decile {i*10}th Percentile): {decile}")
```

### 3. **Percentiles**

**Definition**:
Percentiles divide data into 100 equal parts, with each percentile representing 1% of the data. For example:

- The 50th percentile is the median.
- The 90th percentile indicates the value below which 90% of the data falls.

#### Use Case:

Percentiles are commonly used in standardized testing to show how a score compares to others. For example, if a student is in the 90th percentile, they scored better than 90% of the other test-takers.

#### Python Code Example:

```python
# Calculate percentiles using numpy
percentile_25 = np.percentile(data, 25)  # 25th Percentile
percentile_50 = np.percentile(data, 50)  # 50th Percentile (Median)
percentile_90 = np.percentile(data, 90)  # 90th Percentile

print(f"25th Percentile: {percentile_25}")
print(f"50th Percentile (Median): {percentile_50}")
print(f"90th Percentile: {percentile_90}")
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Numpy's `percentile` Function**: 
   The `numpy.percentile()` function calculates the nth percentile of a dataset. This is used to compute the quartiles, deciles, and percentiles.

2. **Quartiles**: We calculated Q1, Q2, and Q3, which correspond to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles.

3. **Deciles**: The deciles are calculated by iterating over the dataset and computing the 10th, 20th, ..., 90th percentiles.

4. **Percentiles**: Specific percentiles such as the 25th, 50th, and 90th are calculated for demonstration.

### Example Output:

```
Q1 (25th Percentile): 17.5
Q2 (50th Percentile, Median): 32.5
Q3 (75th Percentile): 47.5
D1 (Decile 10th Percentile): 12.5
D2 (Decile 20th Percentile): 17.5
D3 (Decile 30th Percentile): 22.5
D4 (Decile 40th Percentile): 27.5
D5 (Decile 50th Percentile): 32.5
D6 (Decile 60th Percentile): 37.5
D7 (Decile 70th Percentile): 42.5
D8 (Decile 80th Percentile): 47.5
D9 (Decile 90th Percentile): 52.5
25th Percentile: 17.5
50th Percentile (Median): 32.5
90th Percentile: 52.5
```

### Summary:

- **Quartiles** divide data into four parts (Q1, Q2, Q3).
- **Deciles** divide data into ten parts (D1 to D9).
- **Percentiles** divide data into 100 parts (P1 to P100).
